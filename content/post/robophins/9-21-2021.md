Today, we successfully ran another livestream on Twitch for the Chicago Public Library's YOUmedia program. Last weekend, we planned out the structure of our stream; a brief introduction from Katelyn, a slideshow by Juan, a hands-on demo with Ian, and an outro with Katelyn. 

Our preparation for this stream began last weekend, when we planned out the lesson plan of our stream, as well as the practical aspects of running the stream on our school's network. Yesterday, I brought my microphone and audio interface, as well as borrowed our teacher's webcam in order to dry-run the stream. We came to the realization that Twitch, our video streaming platform of choice, was effectively unusable through our school's firewall, so we had to arrange a login to bypass this.

Immediately after school ended today, I set up my laptop in our robotics room, and ensured that our audio and video feeds were working properly. The stream was set to start at 4, so we went live 10 minutes prior. Our stream ran as planned, with an average viewership of 20 and some questions in the chat, which we made sure to answer. Overall, this was a successful stream, and we are in the process of planning another one soon.
