To celebrate and prepare for the start of a new and hopefully normal robotics season, we gathered at Anthony’s house to get into the spirit of the robotics season. Filled with fun and excitement, we were welcomed by an interesting series of tasks for the Freight Frenzy season. Here’s some notes for initial plans on how to tackle each task.

**Delivering ducks:**
- Fast spinner and place duck in middle of carousel
- Spin a little, then launch
  - Test a consistent velocity that would help 
- 3 second max cycle time for all 10 ducks


**Team marker:**
- ~~Tungsten cube to place on the shared hub to tilt the hub~~
  - Not allowed by &lt;GS4&gt;a
- Use a team marker placer similar to that in Skystone; small and light.


**Drivebase:**
The drivebase will be a tough challenge this year due to the barrier that separates the warehouses and the scoring hubs.

- Small bot to fit through 13.7’’ gap 
  - (tolerances on field are +/- 1.0 inch)
  - Bot can be blocked from travelling in gap
  - Mecanum vs. Swerve?
  - Faster since no bump, but less room to build
- Large bot to go over bump
  - Will mecanums work?
  - Odometry no longer optimal

**Game Plan:**
- Recognizing barcode with team marker
  - 20 points vs. 10 points for barcode with duck
- Spend most of driver control period delivering to the shared hub
  - 4 points per block
  - Closer and easier to access than alliance shipping hub
  - Bonus 20 points for tipping
- Use most time in Endgame to spin ducks
  - Massive amount of points to spin all ducks off 6 per duck!
  - Attempt team marker capping
  - Place ducks on alliance shipping hub since they’re light and close by

This is just a start to our thinking for how to conquer the tasks and what to focus on.
