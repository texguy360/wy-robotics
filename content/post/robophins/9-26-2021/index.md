As we are starting up another season of robotics as well as school, we are also getting into the swing of things in terms of volunteering and outreach. Katelyn has been attempting to find opportunities for the rest of the team to volunteer at and spread FIRST. We found this half-marathon volunteering as a great opportunity to help out at a community event and also gain some funds for our team as well, proving this is a win-win for us. Although finding members to attend the half-marathon proved to be quite a challenge as we had a schoolwide event the day before, we were able to get a good amount of people to volunteer and help out, which was definitely helpful.

On the day of the half-marathon, we had a shift from 9 AM to 12 PM, which was definitely preferable in terms of time and convenience for all of our members that were planning on helping out. The location of the half-marathon was in Jackson Park, so finding the actual location of the volunteer spot was a bit of a difficulty, however we ended up finding the proper volunteer location in the end. We had a great time working with other volunteers and our own team members to do team building activities and outreach activities, and were extremely satisfied with how the event ended up turning out. Following this, we were able to communicate with the volunteer directors at the marathon to coordinate future events regarding volunteering with them, including turkey trot. We were very grateful for the opportunity, and are looking forward to future events and volunteering opportunities with lifetime as well!
