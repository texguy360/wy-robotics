Our first official meeting of the year happened today after school. The club fair video was posted a few days ago and we had a much larger turn out than I thought we would. We started off the meeting by introducing ourselves and then going over a slideshow with information about FTC and also expectations for the club.  After answering questions about how the season was going, we showed the new members the game video for Freight Frenzy. I also passed out the freight pieces we had leftover from Rover Ruckus so that people could start prototyping designs for a lifter and drive base. 

Dominic and Cyrus’s group designed a lifter that would use a conveyor belt to move the pieces of freight up to the different levels of the shipping hub. Sunshine and Steven’s group drew a very nice looking mechanical claw to pick up the pieces. A few of us went around to engage the new members and show off a few of our old drive bases and prototypes to show them more about what we do on robotics. Overall, I feel like today’s meeting was very productive and many of the new members are interested in returning next week. We plan to start sharing ideas and prototyping in the next few meetings since we have an impending first meet, probably next month.
