At the meeting, the new members continued on their designs from last week. There were also people whose first meetings were today, so we introduced them to the game video and had them start brainstorming. We were originally going to have each group present their ideas to each other, but we finished setting up the field earlier in the day during some of our senior project classes so we decided to introduce the groups to the game field. We also gave them a tour of our main and basement workspaces-where different parts are, where our tools are, how to keep the room organized, etc. Each group spent around 20 minutes on the field, getting used to the game elements and structures. Many of them expressed how surprised they were at how small the game elements actually were. 

All the groups ended up redesigning a lot of their ideas to adjust to the actual field. Sunshine and Si-Eunâ€™s group ended up scrapping their claw design and drew a sweeper intake instead. Another group spent the rest of the meeting discussing the viability of a smaller robot and whether or not certain wheels would be able to get over the barriers. The last group became more interested in the carousel and decided to focus on that instead of an intake. Next week, we plan on finally sharing our ideas and start building prototypes.
