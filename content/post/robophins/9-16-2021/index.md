Since people were familiar with Robotics now, we split into groups to continue designing the candy dispenser machines. There were a few new people who were not present at the previous Robotics meeting so Harbin brought them to a table and went over the basics of robotics and the materials introduced in the previous meeting. 

For the groups designing the candy dispenser, the members who are more experienced went around to each group to hear their potential ideas and give them a little guidance on what's possible/doable, and what isn't. They came up with ideas ranging from an arm that would grab the candy and place it into the user's hand, to a "coin-pusher" style dropper system. With a few groups who had a solid understanding of what they wanted to do, we brought out supplies so that they could start building the machines and testing them. 

By the end of the meeting, people had a better direction that they wanted to go with the candy dispenser and some even had rough prototypes. The new members were caught up to what robotics is and were ready to get designing.
