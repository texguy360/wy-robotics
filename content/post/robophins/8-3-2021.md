Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it has definitely been tough to reach out to our community and help others learn about engineering, CAD and code. However, we have recently partnered up with the Chicago Public Library through Twitch, and we have been working hard to draft up content, organize streaming dates, create flyers and promote through our various social media platforms, and much more in order to develop a long-term partnership with the Chicago Public Library and Youmedia. Here are some recaps of previous live streams we have done:

## 5/4/2021
This was our very first livestream with the CPL! We planned on doing a livestream introducing FIRST Tech Challenge as well as our team, along with our robot/what we do. Since this our first time doing something like this, we were very thorough in preparing, and communicated with Taylor, the representative of YouMedia/Chicago Public Library Twitch, in terms of livestream setup, as well as various promotions like social media, and advertising. The stream ended up going extremely well, and we had an average of 20 viewers for our very first stream! The replay video of the stream got 150+ views, so we were extremely excited about the success of our first stream, especially since this was very new to us. We also discussed the potential idea of doing a stream a week, however this idea was shut down as a result of the upcoming AP exams that we would have to take as well as final exams. We ended up settling on doing about one stream every other week or every three weeks to keep our schedules balanced.

## 7/9/2021
Due to AP exams as well as final exams marking the end of school, we took a break from streaming to get into the groove of summer and other outreach activities that we were planning for the rest of the summer. Katelyn ended up reaching back out to Taylor and coordinated another livestream to touch on the coding aspects of engineering and robotics. We as a team believed that, after some discussion, Python would be the best path to teach and introduce code to young individuals watching our demonstrations and livestreams, and would also be a good route for us in terms of future content. Julian, Anthony, Harbin, and Katelyn ran the livestream that day, and we ended up having some engagement and discussion in chat, which really motivated us as a team to keep content very involved and educational. This also gave us numerous opportunities to affiliate and partner with other organizations in Chicago, namely Chicago Public Library and MakerSpace. Along with this, we have been occasionally updating our social media platforms to accompany our design and outreach process throughout the summer.

## 8/3/2021
As school is coming up around the corner, we were very interested in fitting in one last livestream before the busy schedule of school prevents increased partnership opportunities. As our previous stream had relations with the coding aspect of robotics, we wanted to touch on the design and prototyping portion as well. As it would be very difficult to plan a get together to do any sort of building in person (due to the pandemic) we agreed as a team that introducing computer-aided design (CAD) would be an awesome middleground for what was workable and viable at the time. Harbin and Katelyn mainly did most of the work on the slideshow presentation, while the other members planned out the demonstration and the various projects that we would showcase on the livestream. The livestream went very well, and Anthony, Katelyn, Julian, and Harbin did a great job of engaging and educating our viewers. Taylor also mentioned and brought up various times that they were receiving many viewers at the library location as well as many people who watched the replay video to learn more about robotics and engineering. We are very excited for our next few livestreams, and we plan on discussing more hardware and building related streams in the future once we return back to school.
