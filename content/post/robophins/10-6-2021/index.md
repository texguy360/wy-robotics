Today I(Toby) built and tested different sizes of intake boxes to see which would give us the most usability while not compromising points by taking control of 2 minerals.
I found dimensions in CAD that I thought would work well and built a cardboard box according to such dimensions. This size did work and it fit both the ball and the box but it didn't maximize the size to intake the minerals easiest. I wanted to try something bigger so I measured a box that was just under the size of 2 boxes but didn't quite hold them both. I cut out this new box and although it could just barely fit 2 boxes at a certain angle, this means I need to go back and decrease the size a bit. 
<div style="width:50%; float:left; padding-right:1%">
<div style="pointer-events:none">{{< figure src="/img/posts/10-6-2021/compare.png" title="Intake Box Sizing" >}}</div>
</div>
<div style="width:50%; float:left; padding-left:1%">
<div style="pointer-events:none">{{< figure src="/img/posts/10-6-2021/two-blocks.png" title="Two Blocks Testing" >}}</div>
</div>
However, now that I have a size that is really close to what we are eventually going to use, I can use these dimensions in the cad model to plan out the rest of the intake.
