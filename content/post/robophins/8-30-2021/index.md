We met after school today to discuss our plans for the upcoming club fair on September 21st.  Today was a busy and tiring first day of school but we were excited to finally have robotics in-person again. The first thing we discussed was how we were going to organize the information about our club like meeting dates and how to interest people in the things we do. We decided to have a standard tri-fold board with the main information on it. Another board will be split into sections to emphasize the pillars of our club like leadership and outreach. We will also have many pictures to show off the aspects of our club like engineering, CAD, coding, outreaching, and fundraising. 

One of the ideas we thought about to attract attention to our table was to have candy to give out. We are going to build a candy dispenser with our parts to make a cool display and also show off a little bit of what we do. We are also planning on repurposing the old tile runner base and attaching a board on a pole so we can drive it around where the club fair is being held. This would be attention grabbing and draw people to our table. Ian and Toby also suggested that they would 3-D print small models to hand out to people as well. 

We also discussed a bit about how our team dynamics are going to work for the new season. The main problem is that the only person on our team who isn’t a senior this year is Katelyn. We need to find a way to retain the new members that show up because of club fair. Historically, we have huge show up rates but commitment dwindles over time and we only have a few of those members left by the end of the season. We want to implement a 1-on-1 mentorship system with the new and old members so that people will feel more included and comfortable exploring their interests. We will also do what we did in previous years and hold workshops for people who don’t have that much experience.

The last thing we did today was deal out roles and tasks for people. Katelyn and I will work on the board and the visuals for a display. Toby, Anthony, Ian, and Ehis will work on the candy dispenser. Julian, Juan, and Harbin will work on the tile runner with the board.
