At the start of practice, we gave each group a white board and time to consolidate their ideas before presenting to the rest of the team. The first group that went was Nina’s group. Their design consisted of a large rectangular bot with a possible tank drive and an elevator mechanism to get the freight to the different levels of the shipping hub. They also thought of an intake using many of the compliance wheels we have to suck in the pieces one at a time. Louie’s group also thought of using tank treads on the drive base along with a moveable conveyor belt to get the pieces to where they need to be. It seems that conveyor belts are an incredibly popular idea because Dominic’s group also thought about using one at an angle. They also decided on using a small compliance wheel attachment to spin the carousel. After the presentations, we partnered with each group to start prototyping. They each chose a specific part to build first. Nina’s group started building the frame and intake, Louie’s group started the drive base, and Dominic’s group started building a carousel part.
