## Core Values

As a team that competes in FIRST, we value not only a well-constructed robot, but also the hours of dedication, brainstorming, and testing behind it. We spend hours after school every day working on the robot, and some weekends as well. We often go through 3 or 4 prototypes and we continue to tweak our designs, long after competition season is over. Our strategies have improved over time through practice on the field and tough lessons learned during competitions. Most importantly, however, we recognize that FIRST is not only about building the best robot but also outreach, communication, and leadership skills. We aim to strengthen ourselves as both individuals and teammates. We hope that through these efforts, we can inspire others to pursue STEM and promote the values of gracious professionalism.
