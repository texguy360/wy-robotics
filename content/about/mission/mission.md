## Mission

Our mission is to expand our skills in science and technology through hands-on experience in the FIRST robotics program. We will develop our communication and leadership skills, promote the FIRST message of cooperation and gracious professionalism, and compete with the utmost respect and integrity.

  

_This means that we challenge ourselves everyday when building and designing a functioning robot. We are constantly improving our robot and learning from our mistakes. During competitions we respect not just each other but our alliance partner, opponents, and event personnel as well. We also inspire the younger generation to pursue STEM through mentorship and demonstration._
