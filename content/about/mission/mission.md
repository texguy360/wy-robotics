Mission

![](Mission%20and%20Core%20Values/ec60efce63d2e8ddd534c768001f39b8.jpg)

Our mission is to expand our skills in science and technology through hands-on experience in the FIRST robotics program. We will develop our communication and leadership skills, promote the FIRST message of cooperation and gracious professionalism, and compete with the utmost respect and integrity.

  

_This means that we challenge ourselves everyday when building and designing a functioning robot. We are constantly improving our robot and learning from our mistakes. During competitions we respect not just each other but our alliance partner, opponents, and event personnel as well. We also inspire the younger generation to pursue STEM through mentorship and demonstration._

Core Values
-----------

As a team that competes in FIRST, we value not only a well-constructed robot, but also the hours of dedication, brainstorming, and testing behind it. We spend hours after school every day working on the robot, and some weekends as well. We often go through 3 or 4 prototypes and we continue to tweak our designs, long after competition season is over. Our strategies have improved over time through practice on the field and tough lessons learned during competitions. Most importantly, however, we recognize that FIRST is not only about building the best robot but also outreach, communication, and leadership skills. We aim to strengthen ourselves as both individuals and teammates.We hope that through these efforts, we can inspire others to pursue STEM and promote the values of gracious professionalism.

We are Whitney Young Robotics, established in 2008 at Whitney Young Magnet High School, situated in the Near West Side of Chicago, IL. Since our inception, we've built a community for students to hone their skills in computer science and engineering. Our program draws in members of different ages and backgrounds, brought together by their passion and dedication. We began in the FIRST Tech Challenge as Team 3216, giving students hands-on experience, teaching gracious professionalism, and providing lifelong skills. In 2018, we registered a second-team, FTC Team 15659, to accommodate expanding interest from the student body.
