## What is FIRST®?

FIRST® (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) is an international robotics program. Founded in 1989 by inventor Dean Kamen, the program inspires young people to become leaders and innovators. The program attracts students from kindergarten through high school to participate in competitions which develop science, technology, communication, and leadership skills.

  

The central principle of FIRST is gracious professionalism. Gracious professionalism, a term coined by Dr. Woodie Flowers, encourages high-quality work and emphasizes respect towards others. Teams cooperate and respect each other, no matter how intense the competition gets.

  

The FIRST community is split into four competitions for different grade levels: FIRST Lego League Jr., FIRST Lego League, FIRST Tech Challenge, and FIRST Robotics Competition. The FIRST organization also provides support beyond high school. Every year, FIRST alumni earn millions of dollars in scholarships to further their careers in the field of STEM.
