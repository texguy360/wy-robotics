We're Whitney Young Robotics,a program made up of students who are passionate about robotics in Chicago,IL. Originally established in 2008 as a place for students to practice their skills in computer science and engineering,our program draws in members from different ages and backgrounds, brought together by their dedication and hard work.

  

Over the past 11 years, Whitney Young Robotics has come a long way. We've overcome numerous challenges while fostering connections and spreading awareness of STEM in our community. We started participating in the FIRST Tech Challenge as Team 3216-Robophins. During the 2018-19 season, we added a new team to our family, FTC Team 15659-Young Droids.
