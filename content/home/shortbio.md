We are Whitney Young Robotics, established in 2008 at Whitney Young Magnet High School, situated in the Near West Side of Chicago, IL. Since our inception, we've built a community for students to hone their skills in computer science and engineering. Our program draws in members of different ages and backgrounds, brought together by their passion and dedication. We began in the FIRST Tech Challenge as Team 3216, giving students hands-on experience, teaching gracious professionalism, and providing lifelong skills. In 2018, we registered a second-team, FTC Team 15659, to accommodate expanding interest from the student body.
