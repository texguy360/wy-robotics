Over the past 13 years, Whitney Young Robotics has come a long way. We started participating in the FIRST Tech Challenge as <a href="../post/robophins">Team 3216 - Robophins</a>. During the 2018-19 season, we added a new team to our family, <a href="../post/young-droids">Team 15659 - Young Droids</a>. Through the years of experience, we've met and overcame numerous challenges and also fostered connections and spread awareness of STEM in our community. Challenging ourselves to become future innovators is what drives us to become successful.
