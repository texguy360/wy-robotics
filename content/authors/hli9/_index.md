Hello, and welcome to the Whitney Young Robotics site, club, and team. Hopefully you can stay a while and have some fun while you're here. 

I'm Harbin,

I've been on the robotics team since the 7th grade, but only these recent years have I dedicated much time to it. I primarily design and build for the team, but I also have some other tasks like reaching out for sponsorships and businesses, and building most of this slick website (let me know if it's bad). 

I usually try out whatever I find interesting, so there's much to gain from being on robotics aside from building.

If you have any questions, feel free to send me a dm on <a href="https://bit.ly/3BJoHqN" onclick="window.open('https://bit.ly/3BJoHqN'); return true;">Discord</a>.
